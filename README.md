# 🎧 Android Spotify Wrapped App

This Android app was developed as part of the **CS 2340** class, where I served as the **Team Lead**. The app uses the **Spotify API** to generate a personalized "Spotify Wrapped" experience for users, based on their listening history over a selected time duration. The results are displayed in a **story-like format**, similar to Spotify's annual Wrapped feature.

## 🚀 Features

- **Select a Time Duration**: Users can choose different time durations (last month, last 6 months, etc.) to generate their Wrapped.
- **Personalized Insights**: Shows top tracks, artists, genres, and more for the selected duration.
- **Story View**: Displays the Wrapped in a story-like format, similar to how Spotify presents their official Wrapped.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Android Studio**: For development and debugging.
- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Spotify Web API**: To retrieve user data.
- **Retrofit**: For making network requests.
- **Picasso**: For image loading.
- **ViewPager2**: For displaying the story-like format.
